        KYIV (Reuters) - Blasts wounded two civilians and shattered several
        hundred windows in the west Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi as Russia
        fired missiles from the Black Sea on Saturday, Ukrainian officials said.
        Ukraine's air force said Russia launched four Kalibr missiles from the
        Black Sea, two of which were shot down by air defences. Two explosions
        were heard in Khmelnytskyi, which lies 170 miles (274 km) west of Kyiv,
        the regional governor said. Oleksandr Symchyshyn, the mayor of
        Khmelnytskyi, said on national television that the explosions, which he
        blamed Russia, had wounded two people, but their injuries were not
        serious. "There are three damaged educational institutions, around ten
        damaged high-rise apartment blocks. Around five hundred windows and
        balconies have been destroyed," he said. Symchyshyn did not say if the
        missiles had struck their targets, or what they were aiming for.
