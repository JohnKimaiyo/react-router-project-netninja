        Shortly after air raid alerts were issued nationwide on Saturday
        morning, authorities in several southern and eastern regions of Ukraine
        warned of possible precautionary power outages to limit damage to the
        grid in case of a strike. Russia, which invaded its neighbour nearly a
        year ago, has been targeting Ukraine's energy networks with massed
        missile salvos since last October. Ukraine's state nuclear company said
        two Russian cruise missiles flew close to the Pivdennoukrainska nuclear
        plant in southern Ukraine just before 08:30 AM local time (0630 GMT).
